## Executive Summary

**Bravo Academy** is a proprietary, full-stack ed-tech solution engineered to simulate high-stakes testing environments (ISSB). Built on a decoupled microservices-ready architecture, it leverages **Next.js 16** for a reactive edge-optimized frontend and **Django 5** for a robust, secure API layer.

The platform distinguishes itself through strict security compliance (HttpOnly JWTs, RBAC, CSP), real-time performance analytics, and a scalable asset management system handling 1,500+ high-fidelity testing assets.

---

## Technical Architecture

The system follows a modern **Headless Architecture**, strictly separating the presentation layer from business logic to ensure scalability and independent deployment cycles.

### Core Stack
| Component | Technology | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | **Next.js 16 (React 19)** | App Router, Server Actions, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Zustand |
| **Backend** | **Django 5.1 (DRF)** | ViewSets, Serializers, Signals, Gunicorn, WhiteNoise |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL (Supabase)** | Row Level Security (RLS), Connection Pooling, JSONB Support |
| **Auth** | **JWT (Cookie-Based)** | SimpleJWT, HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Argon2 Hashing |
| **Storage** | **S3 Compatible** | Direct-to-cloud media delivery, Secure Presigned URLs |

### Security & Compliance
- **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Mitigates XSS by verifying all script sources.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for Student, Admin, and Developer roles.
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Hardware-locked sessions to prevent account sharing.
- **Throttling & Rate Limiting**: Distributed protection against brute-force attacks across all Auth/API endpoints.

---

## Key Features

### Adaptive Testing Engine
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles MCQ, True/False, and time-critical Word Association Tests (WAT).
- **Latency-Aware Timer**: Server-authoritative timing logic to prevent client-side manipulation.
- **Resilient Sessions**: Auto-resume capability for interrupted tests with precise state restoration.

### Advanced Analytics
- **Performance/Time Correlation**: Detailed scatter plots analyzing time-taken vs. accuracy.
- **Category Benchmarking**: Automatic grading against historical cohort data (Verbal/Non-Verbal/Abstract).
- **History Tracking**: Long-term longitudinal data visualization using `Recharts`.

### Administrative Command Center
- **User Lifecycle Management**: Full CRUD capabilities for user access and ban management.
- **Content CMS**: Dynamic question bank management with bulk-upload and S3 asset linking.
- **Payment Verification**: Manual and automated workflow for premium test access verification.

## Deployment Strategy

The infrastructure is designed for high availability and zero-downtime updates.

- **Frontend (Edge)**: Deployed on **Vercel**, leveraging Edge Network for sub-millisecond static asset delivery.
- **Backend (Compute)**: Deployed on **Render**, utilizing auto-scaling workers for API request handling.
- **Data Persistence**: Managed **Supabase** instance with automated daily backups and point-in-time recovery.
